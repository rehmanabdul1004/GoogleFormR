# Selenium Test Automation for Google Form Submission

This project demonstrates how to automate the process of filling out a Google Form using Selenium WebDriver with Java. The test script is designed to interact with a Google Form, fill in fields like name, debrief, experience, date, and time, and submit the form. It uses TestNG for test management and custom wrapper methods to handle common interactions.
